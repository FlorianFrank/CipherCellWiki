This chapter explains how to install all components either **automatically** or **manually**.

## Automated and Guided Installation of All Components

This repository provides a collection of scripts designed to **automate the setup of the srsRAN-based test environment**.  
All necessary scripts can be found in the **`srsRAN_test_environment/scripts`** directory.

By running: 

```bash
cd srsRAN_test_environment/scripts
./build_all.sh
```

This will launch an interactive dialog where you can select various options, such as the build type. For example:

```bash 
$ ./build_all.sh

Docker-based compilation is available for your system: macOS 15.5.
Choose your build type:
1: Docker
2: Native
Enter choice (1 or 2): 1
You chose Docker build.
Compile all components?
Enter choice (y or n): n
Compile sc ric?
Enter choice (y or n): y
Compile core network?
Enter choice (y or n): y
Compile gnb network?
Enter choice (y or n): y
Compile srs ran 4G?
Enter choice (y or n): y
Compile SRC RIC of build type: 1
Patching sc-ric docker-compose.yml for macOS systems
```
The main script relies on helper scripts in **scripts/compile**, which use Python to compile individual components while handling error checking and generating log files. The corresponding logs are stored in **scripts/logs/compile**.  

For Docker-based compilation, the script uses the projectâ€™s own Dockerfiles when available. If not, custom Dockerfiles are provided, copied into the project folder, and executed during installation. All Dockerfiles are located in the **docker** directory.

### Additional Notes

- The **srsUE** component, found in the [srsRAN_4G project](https://github.com/srsran/srsRAN_4G), cannot be built locally on macOS due to the lack of TUN/TAP support. It must therefore be compiled and run inside a Docker container.
