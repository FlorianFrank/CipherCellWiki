## What is O-RAN?
Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is an open and disaggregated approach to building mobile networks. It aims to create a **multi-vendor, interoperable, and intelligent RAN ecosystem** by separating hardware and software components and leveraging open interfaces.

### Key Objectives:
- **Openness:** Use of open standards and interoperable interfaces.
- **Disaggregation:** Splitting RAN into multiple functional units (O-RU, O-DU, O-CU).
- **Intelligence:** Integration of AI/ML for optimization and automation.
- **Vendor Diversity:** Allow operators to mix and match components from different vendors.

## Why O-RAN Matters
Traditional RAN solutions are monolithic and vendor-locked, which limits flexibility and innovation. O-RAN addresses these challenges by:
- Reducing **CAPEX/OPEX** through vendor competition.
- Enabling **network agility** for 5G and beyond.
- Supporting **AI-driven optimization** and automation.
- Accelerating innovation via an **open-source community** (O-RAN Software Community).

## Evolution from Traditional RAN to O-RAN
| Feature            | Traditional RAN | O-RAN               |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------|
| Vendor Lock-in     | Yes            | No                  |
| Architecture       | Monolithic     | Disaggregated       |
| Interfaces         | Proprietary    | Open and Standard   |
| Intelligence       | Limited        | AI/ML-Driven        |

## O-RAN Alliance
The **O-RAN Alliance** is the main standardization body driving O-RAN specifications.  
It focuses on:
- Defining **open interfaces**.
- Ensuring **interoperability** across vendors.
- Developing **reference designs and standards**.

**Key working groups** include:
- WG1: Use Cases and Overall Architecture
- WG3: RAN Management
- WG7: White-box Hardware
