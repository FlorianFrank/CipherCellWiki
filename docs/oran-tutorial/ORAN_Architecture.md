# Basic Components

Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) is an evolving framework that emphasizes openness, intelligence, and flexibility in telecom networks. Its architecture spans multiple layers and components, enabling efficient service management and orchestration:

- **O-RU (O-RAN Radio Unit):** Handles radio signal transmission and reception at the physical layer.  
- **O-DU (O-RAN Distributed Unit):** Manages real-time baseband processing and lower-layer protocols.  
- **O-CU-CP (O-RAN Central Unit – Control Plane):** Responsible for non-real-time control and signaling functions.  
- **O-CU-UP (O-RAN Central Unit – User Plane):** Manages user data traffic with low latency.  
- **Near-Real-Time RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller):** Provides policy-driven and AI-assisted optimization for RAN functions.  
- **Service Management and Orchestration Framework:** Coordinates lifecycle management, network slicing, and resource allocation across O-RAN components.  

This layered approach enables interoperability, vendor flexibility, and the integration of intelligent control for next-generation mobile networks.
