The **Service Management and Orchestration (SMO)** framework provides **centralized management, automation, and orchestration** for the entire O-RAN ecosystem. It coordinates the lifecycle of network components, ensures efficient resource allocation, and enables advanced features like network slicing and automation.
It interacts closely with the Near-RT RIC; while the SMO operates on a timescale of seconds, the Near-RT RIC functions in the millisecond domain.

#### Key Responsibilities
- **Policy Definition and Enforcement:** Collaborates with RICs via the A1 interface to create, update, and enforce intent-based policies that guide xApp behavior in the Near-RT RIC—for example, optimizing carrier or band selection for specific UEs or UE groups to enhance performance and balance network load.  
- **Statistical Analysis:** Provides the Near-RT RIC with enriched analytics from UE measurements—such as RSRP, RSRQ, and CQI for both serving and neighboring cells—enabling more precise optimization and decision-making.  
- **Lifecycle Management:** Automates deployment, configuration, scaling, and updates of O-RAN components (O-RU, O-DU, O-CU, and RICs), supporting both cloud-native and edge deployments.  
- **Network Slicing:** Creates and manages multiple virtual RAN slices to meet specific service requirements—including latency, throughput, and reliability—for different applications or user groups.  
- **Fault, Performance, and Configuration Management:** Monitors the health of network elements, collects KPIs and performance metrics, detects anomalies or faults, and applies corrective actions or triggers automated workflows to maintain network stability.

#### Connectivity
- **O1 Interface:** 
    > Connects the SMO to individual RAN components (O-CU, O-DU, O-RU) for **element-level monitoring, performance metrics collection (KPIs), configuration management, and fault detection**. 
- **A1 Interface:** 
    > Connects the SMO to the **Non-RT RIC** for **policy definition, distribution, and analytics**, allowing intent-based control of xApps in the Near-RT RIC. Supports network optimization decisions based on enriched data from SMO and RAN elements.  
- **O2 Interface:** 
    > Provides the SMO with the capability to **orchestrate and manage the full lifecycle of virtualized or cloud-native RAN components**, including **deployment, scaling, updates, and termination**. Works at a higher abstraction level than O1, integrating with cloud platforms or orchestration frameworks to automate RAN operations end-to-end.

#### **Deployment Context**
- Typically deployed in **centralized cloud or data center environments** for scalable orchestration across multiple sites.
- Supports **multi-vendor interoperability**, enabling operators to manage a heterogeneous network seamlessly.

### Internal structure

Next, we present the internal structure of the SMO framework, detailing its integration with the Non-RT RIC. The architecture is illustrated in the figure below.

#### rApps and the R1 Interface
- Similar in concept to **xApps** deployed on the **Near-RT RIC**.  
- Specific **rApps** (RAN applications) can be deployed within the **Non-RT RIC**, which is part of the SMO.  
- rApps interact with the Non-RT RIC framework services using the **R1 interface** (open APIs).  

#### Implementation Variability
- Certain components are **implementation-dependent** and can be placed either:  
  - **Internal to the Non-RT RIC** (tightly integrated), or  
  - **External but accessible via exposure functions** (loosely coupled).  
- Examples include:  
  - **AI/ML workflow functions**  
    - Model training and retraining  
    - Inference pipelines  
    - Model lifecycle management  s

#### Other SMO Framework Functions
- Functions that are **external to the Non-RT RIC**, but still part of the SMO.  
- Marked in the architecture as **Other SMO Framework Functions**.  
- Examples include:  
  - **Network slicing lifecycle management** (design, instantiation, scaling, termination)  
  - **End-to-end service orchestration** (across RAN, transport, and core)  
  - **Resource inventory and assurance**
