When 3G networks were introduced, the radio unit was divided into two components: the Remote Radio Head (RRH), which contained all radio functions and was positioned close to the antenna, and the Baseband Unit (BBU), which handled baseband processing functions. Each BBU and RRH was connected via a dedicated network segment known as the fronthaul, laying the foundation for more advanced and flexible RAN architectures.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"oran-tutorial/protocol_stack":{"id":"oran-tutorial/protocol_stack","title":"Protocol Stack","description":"Splitting control-plane processing from user-plane processing allows for more flexible and efficient network deployment.
